# HCGP: Humble Code for Gaussian Processes

**Author: Louis Perenon**

with inputs from: Matteo Martinelli and Stéphane Ilić.

## Purpose of the Code

This code allows to optimise single-task and multi-task Gaussian processes. For the single-task case, the code can compute any combination of kernels and their derivatives given the capacity of SymPy. For the multi-task case, only the Squared Exponential x Squared Exponential convolutions have been implemented so far.

## Prerequisites, installation, and usage

This code uses: NumPy, SymPy, Matplotlib
